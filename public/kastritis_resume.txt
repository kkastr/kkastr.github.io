PROFILE
Data scientist and software developer building LLM-based applications, predictive models, and research-grade
simulations. Strong in Python, scientific computing, and machine learning with practical experience designing
end-to-end data pipelines, model development, and deployment.

SKILLS
Programming: Python, C, C++, TypeScript, SQL, CUDA
ML / Data: NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, scikit-learn, PyTorch, Matplotlib, Plotly
LLM / Systems: Context and prompt engineering (system instructions, JSON-structured outputs), multi-model
orchestration and agentic workflows
Backend: FastAPI, WebSockets
Frontend: React, Tailwind
DevOps: Git, Linux, Docker, GitHub Actions

EXPERIENCE
Synecho – Founder & Lead Developer
Jun 2025 – Present · Remote | https://synecho.app
• Launched a SaaS that analyzes variation in LLM outputs so users can track shifts in brand/topic perception
across repeated prompts.
• Built a React/Tailwind UI with a prompt workflow and dashboard for statistics, judge summaries, and
per-request prompt–response transcripts.
• Implemented a Python/FastAPI backend coordinating async, parallel calls to Gemini, Groq, and OpenAI,
aggregating outputs into quantitative metrics (similarity, sentiment, term/phrase statistics).
• Designed an LLM-as-judge layer using system instructions and JSON-structured outputs to produce reliable
summaries and constrain hallucinations.
• Orchestrated a multi-step, agentic LLM workflow (candidate models + judge model) to aggregate, score, and
summarize responses into actionable insights.
• Improved perceived latency with concurrent API requests and WebSocket streaming for judge output;
deployed on a VPS with SQLite and CI/CD via GitHub Actions.
Researcher – Ontario Tech University
Jun 2024 – Nov 2024
• Extended physics simulation software (Python/C++), enabling new experiment types and parameter sweeps.
• Analyzed simulation and experimental datasets with Python (NumPy/Pandas), generating plots and metrics
for publication.
• Drafted manuscript sections and figures for peer-reviewed journals, validating results with statistical methods.
• Contributed to research discussions, proposing data-driven approaches to modeling and analysis.
Researcher – Ontario Tech University
Sep 2021 – Jun 2022
• Built data pipelines in Python to ingest, clean, and store simulation outputs, improving storage efficiency.
• Defined metrics to quantify experimental/simulation behavior, reducing data collection overhead.
• Enhanced simulation tooling to automate batch runs and post-processing, enabling more complex studies.
• Provided technical guidance to graduate students on data analysis and scripting.

Graduate Research & Teaching Assistant – Ontario Tech University
Jan 2015 – Dec 2020
• Developed C++/CUDA APIs for GPU-capable simulation software, increasing performance by ~50% and
enabling faster simulation studies.
• Provided data-driven and theoretical insights to experimental collaborators and co-authored two
peer-reviewed publications based on combined simulation and experimental results.
• Supported group migration to GPU computing; wrote documentation and trained six students in custom
simulation tools.
• Led labs and tutorials for physics and computer science courses (quantum mechanics, Linux, Python
programming).
• Taught ~50 students per term core skills in Linux, Python, file system management, and data visualization.

SELECTED PROJECTS
Polymer Conformation Generation (https://alysides.kastritis.dev) | PyTorch, Transformers, FastAPI, React
• Trained a transformer model on MD simulation data of coarse-grained semiflexible polymers to learn the
equilibrium distribution of bond vectors and chain conformations.
• Used the model to sample near-equilibrated chains as MD starting states, reducing the need for long
thermalization runs whose relaxation time grows at least quadratically with chain length.
• Built an interactive FastAPI + React web app where users select chain length (within limits for performance),
generate sample conformations on demand, and inspect basic configuration statistics.
Social Media Sentiment Analysis | Python, SQL, scikit-learn, PRAW, Plotly
• Scraped posts and comments from five subreddits with PRAW and stored 25,000+ comments in a SQL
database via Pandas.
• Trained a scikit-learn classifier for sentiment analysis, achieving 86% accuracy on held-out data.
• Built a dashboard with six key metrics (sentiment by subreddit, comment volume over time, etc.) to explore
Reddit user behavior.
